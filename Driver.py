#Examples how to call a method from a different Python file:


# store it in a variable
# int x = test(1)

# print it
# print(test(2))

# print it with context!
# print("test(test(4)) =" + test(test(4)))


# The tests should print the intended output in addition to the actual output.
# You should also replace the placeholder text with an actual function call.

# print("makeBricks(1,1,2) expected false result: " + "REPLACE THIS")
# print("makeBricks(1,1,6) expected true  result: " + "REPLACE THIS" )
